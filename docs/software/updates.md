# Updates

The Centauri Carbon during startup checks [an endpoint on chituiot.com](https://mms.chituiot.com/mainboardVersionUpdate/getInfo.do7?machineType=ELEGOO%20Centauri%20Carbon&machineId=0&version=1.1.0&lan=en&firmwareType=1) to check if a new firmware update is available.

!!! question "Speculation"
    These firmware updates seem to be encrypted (very high entropy).

    I suspect, looking at the coredump, that the result after decryption is a bz2 archive.
